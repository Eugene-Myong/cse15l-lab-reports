Greetings and welcome back. Today we have a shorter tutorial for you, and don't worry, I'll only charge you $145.

I apologize for the weird side scrolling bars thing with the last Lab Report. I do hope it doesn't happen with this one. Never seen anything like it either, and google 
surprisingly had nothing for me. Weird. 

Nevertheless, let's get started.

## Part 1: Vim
### No I didn't misspell him these commands are just spelled weird ok

Today I shall guide you through the process of making a simple edit through the command line. I know right, you don't have to edit the file directly, you can use `vim` 
and the command line and still make any edits! Pretty cool.

Before we get started though, we need to learn how to use `vim`. Well, you've come to the right place. Enter: Vimtutor Eugene Edition!

Note: when you see something in *italics* that means press that button. I would use angle brackets (<> these things) but putting something in them already has a function,
so italics it is.

**Moving around**: When you enter a file with the `vim` command, you will be able to freely navigate the contents of that file using your cursor. The easiest way to do this is through the
arrow keys, with each arrow key corresponding to their directions. If you don't have any arrow keys though, fear not, for you can use *h* to go left, *l* to go right, 
*k* to go up, and *j* to go down. 

**Normal Mode**: Normal mode is where you can naviagte the file with your cursor. Whenver you enter another mode and want to get back to normal mode, press *ESC*.

**Deleting a character**: To delete a character, all you have to do is press *x* and the character under your cursor will be sent to the shadow realm. Sorry buddy.
